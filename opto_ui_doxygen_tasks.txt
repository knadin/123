QT
Experiment a little with examples - IDE overview 
Stay away from QML, QUICK / HTTP - want Widget based (C++)
Setting up toolkit
Build - debug / release - make edits - changes - walk through a tutorial - WEB


OPTO source code
review the hierarchy / directory structure
open .pro (project file - QMAKE [nmake, cmake])
how PROJECT pane relates to the directory structure

-> doxygen how to
https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html
... link to the "commands"

-> How I engage doxygen -> QT (.pro) -> doxygen.exe (input doxyfile) -> documentation (output /html)
-> Compile a doxygen document
-> how to document it in source code

>>> Install doxygen
>>> Reboot
>>> Look at .pro file - engages PostBuildEvents.bat - which calls doxygen program
>>> build release from QT - should make the doxygen
>>> make changes - compile release - check results via web browser

Models
------
dbbase.h
dbqueries.h
dbslurper.h
logdata.h
producttablemodel.h
smbase.h
statusdata.h

All:
class
class public interface
signals
public slots


@brief = description : TBD
@param xxxx : TBD

Globals
-------
every namespace, enum, extern, struct 
do not delete anything called @internal
enum and struct can use special "///<" for field, again TBD is fine
once or twice I used "///<" on extern - I think just for "whitespace" prettiness
leave c++ comments "//" although I will probably remove

ALL OTHERS
----------
\dialogs
\docks
\toolbars
\uicomponents
\views

all .h - same as models (i.e. all public interfaces)
